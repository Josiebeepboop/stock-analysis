Refactoring written code to enhance efficiency

## Overview of Project
The client, Steve, prepared a workbook with Macro properties to analyze stock data that he has collected. He would like to continue adding on to this data. He is concerned that in the long run, the analysis will take longer. He would like us to look at the code he has already entered and find a way to make the analysis run faster and smoother.

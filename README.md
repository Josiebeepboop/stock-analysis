## Overview of Project

The client, Steve, prepared a workbook with a macro enabling him to quickly analyze stock data that he has collected. Specifically, it calculates the total daily volumes for different tickers he is following and their returns. This allows him to make informed decisions when investing. He would like to continue adding on to this data, potentially even adding new tickers. However, he is concerned that in the long run, the analysis will take too long. He would like us enhance the code he has already written so that his macro runs faster and smoother for a larger dataset.

## Purpose
Refactor client's macro code so that it runs faster and more efficiently for a larger dataset.

## Summary

Refactoring code helps to make the analysis faster by making the code easier to understand. It can however take a lot of time to perform this, especially when the code is long and complicated.
